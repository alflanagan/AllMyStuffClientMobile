# All My Stuff Mobile Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alflanagan/AllMyStuffClientMobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alflanagan/AllMyStuffClientMobile)

This is the mobile client for my cloud-based note-taking application. Eventually it should support
all kinds of records, not just notes.

Although this is a React Native application, I don't have the equipment to develop and test on
iOS, so it's basically Android-only at this point. Contributions from iOS programmers would be
welcome.
